Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **chair**  \nQuery description: \"this is a black office chair. it is to the left of a computer tower.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 38, 41, 51, 72, 81]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the room. The object IDs for chairs are 25, 27, 29, and 30. The query specifies a black office chair to the left of a computer tower. In the global view, object ID 25 is positioned to the left of object ID 20, which appears to be a computer tower. This matches the view-independent spatial relationship described in the query. \n\nNext, I examined the camera images to validate this observation. In the camera images, object ID 25 is indeed a black office chair and is positioned to the left of a computer tower, confirming the view-dependent spatial relationship. The visual features such as color and shape also match the description of a black office chair.\n\nTherefore, the object ID that best matches the query description is 25."
