Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **mini fridge**  \nQuery description: \"the tiny mini fridge. the mini fridge on the corner by the whiteboard.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [22, 24, 26, 73, 74]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the room. The mini fridge is described as being 'on the corner by the whiteboard.' In the global view, object ID 73 is located near the corner and close to the whiteboard, which is labeled as object ID 24. This matches the view-independent spatial relationship described in the query. \n\nNext, I examined the camera images to validate this candidate. In the camera images, object ID 73 is clearly visible in the corner near the whiteboard, confirming its position. The visual features of object ID 73, such as its size and shape, are consistent with a mini fridge. \n\nObject ID 26 is another fridge, but it is not located in the corner by the whiteboard, as described in the query. Therefore, object ID 73 best matches the description of 'the tiny mini fridge on the corner by the whiteboard.'"
