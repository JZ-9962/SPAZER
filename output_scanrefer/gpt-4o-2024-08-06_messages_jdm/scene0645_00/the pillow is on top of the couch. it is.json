        "content": "\nYou are provided with a set of images depicting an indoor scene:\n- A **global view image** showing the room's 3D layout from a fixed perspective.\n- Several **camera images** captured from different viewpoints around the room.\n\nAll objects of interest in the scene are labeled with unique **object IDs** (in red), which are consistent across both the global and camera images.\n\nYour task is to identify the object ID that best matches the given query description. Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **pillow**  \nQuery description: \"the pillow is on top of the couch. it is on the furthest left.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [9, 17, 21, 26, 30, 32, 38, 48, 50, 51, 60, 82, 88, 120, 123, 156, 158]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the couch and noted the positions of the pillows on it. The query specifies that the pillow is 'on top of the couch' and 'on the furthest left.' In the global view, object ID 51 is on the left side of the couch. Examining the camera images, object ID 51 is consistently shown on the leftmost part of the couch. The other pillows, such as ID 60 and ID 123, are either on the right side or not on the couch. Therefore, object ID 51 best matches the description of being on top of the couch and on the furthest left."
