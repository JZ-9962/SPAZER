Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **file cabinet**  \nQuery description: \"the file cabinet is below the center desk on the right side of the room. the file cabinet is a dark gray box.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [8, 12, 14, 29, 37, 69, 73, 98]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the room. The query describes the file cabinet as being 'below the center desk on the right side of the room' and as a 'dark gray box.' In the global view, object ID 98 is located on the right side of the room under a desk. This matches the description of being below a desk. In the camera images, object ID 98 is confirmed to be a dark gray box, consistent with the description of a file cabinet. Other candidates like IDs 37, 73, and 29 are either not under a desk or not on the right side of the room. Therefore, object ID 98 best matches the query description."
