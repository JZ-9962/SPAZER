Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **chair**  \nQuery description: \"this is a brown leather chair located under the first dark brown table immediately inside the door.  it is on the middle side of the room, relative to the table.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [5, 11, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 28, 30, 31, 37, 39, 41, 43, 46, 52, 55, 60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 68, 78, 79, 83, 85, 87, 90, 94, 97, 98, 103, 121, 125, 126]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the room. The query specifies a brown leather chair under the first dark brown table immediately inside the door, on the middle side of the room relative to the table. In the global view, the table labeled 66 is the first dark brown table near the entrance. The chair labeled 68 is directly under this table and is positioned on the middle side relative to the table. Examining the camera images, the chair labeled 68 is confirmed to be brown and leather, matching the description. Other chairs like 78 and 103 do not fit the description as they are not under the specified table or do not match the color and material. Therefore, the best match for the query is object ID 68."
