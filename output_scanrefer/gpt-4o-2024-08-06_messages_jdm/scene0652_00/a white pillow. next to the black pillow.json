        "content": "\nYou are provided with a set of images depicting an indoor scene:\n- A **global view image** showing the room's 3D layout from a fixed perspective.\n- Several **camera images** captured from different viewpoints around the room.\n\nAll objects of interest in the scene are labeled with unique **object IDs** (in red), which are consistent across both the global and camera images.\n\nYour task is to identify the object ID that best matches the given query description. Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **pillow**  \nQuery description: \"a white pillow. next to the black pillow.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 13, 18, 21, 27, 31, 35, 39, 41, 42]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the pillows on the bed. Object ID 2 is a white pillow positioned next to Object ID 13, which is a black pillow. This matches the query description of 'a white pillow next to the black pillow.' The camera images confirm this spatial relationship, showing Object ID 2 as the white pillow directly adjacent to the black pillow (ID 13). The consistent positioning across different views supports the selection of Object ID 2 as the best match."
