Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **table**  \nQuery description: \"it is a white table. the white table is sitting behind the two brown desks in the far left corner of the room.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [5, 8, 9, 14, 24, 35, 37, 39, 51, 56]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, the query describes a white table located behind two brown desks in the far left corner of the room. In the global view, object IDs 9 and 14 are brown desks positioned in the left area of the room. Behind these desks, in the far left corner, is object ID 56, which appears to be a white table. The camera images confirm this spatial arrangement, showing object ID 56 as a white table situated behind the brown desks (IDs 9 and 14). The view-independent spatial relationship of 'behind' and 'far left corner' is consistent across both views, confirming object ID 56 as the best match."
