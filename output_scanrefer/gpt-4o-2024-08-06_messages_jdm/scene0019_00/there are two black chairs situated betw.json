Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **chair**  \nQuery description: \"there are two black chairs situated between six brown chairs and a black couch. this black chair is next to the black couch. it appears to be leather. it is black. there is a snack machine on the opposite wall.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [5, 7, 8, 9, 11]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout. The black chairs (IDs 5 and 7) are positioned between the brown chairs (IDs 9 and 11) and the black couch (ID 8). The query specifies a black chair next to the black couch, which matches the position of ID 5. The camera images confirm that ID 5 is a black chair next to the black couch, and it appears to be leather. The snack machine is visible on the opposite wall in the global view, further confirming the location. Thus, ID 5 best matches the description."
