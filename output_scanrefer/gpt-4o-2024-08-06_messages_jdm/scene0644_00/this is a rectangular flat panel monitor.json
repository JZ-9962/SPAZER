Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **monitor**  \nQuery description: \"this is a rectangular flat panel monitor. it is the last monitor on the right in the front row of monitors.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 25, 28, 32, 35, 36, 42, 45, 53, 57, 58, 59, 83, 87, 103, 119]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the front row of monitors on the table closest to the bottom of the image. The query specifies the 'last monitor on the right in the front row,' which suggests looking for the rightmost monitor in this row. In the global view, object IDs 28, 42, 53, and 57 are in this row. Next, examining the camera images, I focused on the rightmost monitor in the front row. The images show that object ID 42 is the rightmost monitor in the front row, matching the description of being 'the last monitor on the right.'"
