Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **lamp**  \nQuery description: \"this is a lamp . the lamp is at the corner of the room.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [3, 6]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I observed the overall layout of the room. The lamps with IDs 3 and 6 are positioned on tables at opposite ends of the seating area. The query specifies that the lamp is 'at the corner of the room.' In the global view, ID 3 is located at the far left corner, while ID 6 is at the far right corner. Both are at corners, but ID 3 is more prominently positioned in a corner relative to the room's layout. \n\nNext, I examined the camera images. In the first camera image, ID 3 is clearly visible on a table next to the armchair, reinforcing its position at the corner. The second camera image shows ID 6 in a similar setup but on the opposite side. Both lamps are similar in appearance, but the spatial context from the global view suggests ID 3 is more aligned with the description of being 'at the corner of the room.' \n\nTherefore, based on the spatial relationship and the description, ID 3 is the best match."
