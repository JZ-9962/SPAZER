The chair is next to the black couch and there is a snack machine on the opposite wall. In the global view image, object ID 5 is a black chair positioned between brown chairs (IDs 9, 11, 12) and a black couch (ID 7). This matches the description of being next to the black couch and between brown chairs. The snack machine (ID 4) is on the opposite wall, further confirming the location. Object ID 5 is the most likely match based on these spatial relationships and color descriptions. Other black objects (IDs 7, 8) are couches, not chairs, and do not fit the description as closely."
