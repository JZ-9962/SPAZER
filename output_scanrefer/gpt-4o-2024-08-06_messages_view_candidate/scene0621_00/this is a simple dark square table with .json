Object ID 17: This table is also near the end of the room with four chairs, but the chair on the right does not appear to be a rolling office chair. \n3. Object ID 2: This table is not at the end of the room but has four chairs. \n4. Object ID 43: This table is centrally located and does not match the 'end of the room' description. \n5. Object ID 0: This table is at the opposite end of the room and does not have a rolling office chair on the right side. \n6.
