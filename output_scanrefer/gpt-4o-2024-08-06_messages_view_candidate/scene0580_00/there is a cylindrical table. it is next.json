Object ID 26 is a curtain, and objects 29 and 30 are located near it. Therefore, these are the most likely candidates. Additional IDs such as 36, 37, and 13 are also near curtains, but they do not appear to be tables. Thus, the top five object IDs are ranked based on their shape and proximity to the curtain."
