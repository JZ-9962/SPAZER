Object ID 1 is the most likely match as it appears to have a microwave on top and is positioned against a wall. Object ID 37 is also considered as it is close to ID 1 and might share similar characteristics. The other IDs (17, 22, 40) are included based on their proximity to walls and potential color match, though they lack the clear presence of a microwave."
