In the global view, the northwest table appears to be object 19. The cabinet should be south of this object. Objects 17 and 20 are positioned south of object 19. Both objects 17 and 20 appear to be cabinets in the cropped images. Object 17 has a gray appearance and four legs, matching the description closely. Object 20 also fits the description but seems less prominent. Other objects like 7 and 21 are not south of the table and do not match the description as closely. Therefore, the ranking is based on proximity to the table and visual match to the description."
