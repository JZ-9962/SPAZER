The corners are typically where two walls meet. Based on the image, the chairs positioned in the corners are likely to be IDs 11, 4, 9, and 38. These chairs are located at the intersections of the walls, making them suitable candidates. Among these, ID 11 is in a prominent corner position, followed by ID 4, which is also near a corner. ID 9 and ID 38 are in the other corners. ID 27 is also considered as it is near a corner and could be perceived as being in a corner depending on the room's layout."
