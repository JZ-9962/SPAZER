The chairs labeled '35' and '39' are also relatively close to the viewer and have a similar orientation, but they are slightly further away than '5'. The chairs labeled '38' and '4' are further back but still match the orientation to some extent. Therefore, the top-5 object IDs are ranked based on proximity and orientation."
