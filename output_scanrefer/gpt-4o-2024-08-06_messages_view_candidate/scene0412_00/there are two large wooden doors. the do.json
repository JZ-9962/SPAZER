Object ID 27 is another door that seems to have a wooden texture, but it is less prominent than ID 0. Object ID 20 is adjacent to ID 0 and might be part of a double door setup. Object ID 36 is near ID 20 and could also be part of a door structure. Object ID 9 is another possibility, though it appears less likely to match the description as closely as the others."
