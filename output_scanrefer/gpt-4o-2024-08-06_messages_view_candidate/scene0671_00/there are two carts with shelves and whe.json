In the global view image, objects 15 and 29 are positioned against the wall and resemble carts with shelves. Object 15 is on the left side when facing the wall, making it the most likely match. Object 29 is the other cart, so it is also relevant but less likely. Other objects do not match the description as closely, but objects 13 and 20 are included as they are near the carts and could be part of the same structure or context. Object 28 is also considered as it is near the wall and could be related."
