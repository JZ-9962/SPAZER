In the global view, the far left machine is likely near the entrance, which is at the bottom of the image. The cropped images show object IDs 2, 23, and 57 as white laundry baskets. Object ID 2 is positioned on top of a machine and is closest to the entrance, making it the most likely match. Object ID 23 is also a white basket on a machine but appears further from the entrance. Object ID 57 is another white basket but is less clearly positioned on a machine. Object IDs 56 and 65 are nearby and could potentially match the description if the perspective is slightly different."
