It is 'located to the left of the large larder style kitchen unit'. Based on these attributes, I looked for tall, metallic objects with visible handles in the images. Object ID 2 appears to be a large, stainless steel appliance with a split design, fitting the description of a fridge freezer. Object ID 0 is also a large appliance and could be a fridge. Object ID 24 seems to have a metallic appearance and could be part of a fridge. Object ID 9 and 25 are also considered due to their size and potential metallic look, which might match a fridge freezer."
