Based on the image, the left-most table is near the top-left corner. The chair labeled '3' is directly west of this table and appears to be dark brown. It also seems to have four legs. The other chairs are either not west of the left-most table or do not match the color description as closely. Therefore, the top match is ID 3, followed by other IDs that are less likely but still possible matches."
