Next, I examined the global view to determine which of these armchairs is facing the door. The door is visible near object 9, so I prioritized armchairs near this area. Object 8 is closest to the door and appears to be facing it, making it the most likely candidate. Object 7 is also nearby and could be facing the door, so it is the second choice. Object 4 is further away but still a possibility, so it is the third choice. Object 5 is included as a fourth option due to its proximity to the door."
