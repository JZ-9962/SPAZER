In the cropped images, Object ID 29 shows a window with a fan (Object ID 30) in front of it. This matches the description perfectly. Object ID 28 is another window but does not have a fan in front of it. Object ID 30 is the fan itself, which is relevant to the query. Object ID 9 is another fan, but it is not in front of a window. Therefore, the best matches are ranked based on the presence of both the window and the fan."
