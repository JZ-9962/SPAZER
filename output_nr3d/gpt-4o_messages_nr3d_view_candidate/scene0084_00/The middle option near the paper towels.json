Therefore, ID 25 is the most likely candidate for the 'middle option.' The next closest objects are 24 and 30, which are also near the paper towels. ID 19 is another nearby object that could potentially fit the description. Thus, the selected IDs are ranked based on proximity and centrality to the paper towels."
