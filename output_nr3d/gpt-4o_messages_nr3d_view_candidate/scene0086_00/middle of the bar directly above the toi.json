In the global view image, objects 5, 16, and 6 are associated with the toilet area. Object 5 is directly above the toilet and resembles a bar or rail, making it the most likely candidate. Object 16 is also above the toilet but appears to be part of the flushing mechanism. Object 6 is the toilet itself. Object 17 is near the sink area and not directly above a toilet, but it could be considered if the description is interpreted more broadly."
