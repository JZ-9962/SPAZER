In the global view image, object ID 5 appears to be a paper towel dispenser, and object ID 10 is resting on top of it. Object ID 10 is white, matching the description. The door is visible in the image, and the proximity of object ID 10 to the door further supports this choice. The other objects do not fit the description as closely, as they are not white or not positioned on top of a paper towel dispenser. Therefore, the most likely match is object ID 10, followed by other nearby objects for completeness."
