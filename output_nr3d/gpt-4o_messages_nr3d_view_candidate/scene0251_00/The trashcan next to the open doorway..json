The trashcans are likely to be objects 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 based on their appearance in the cropped images. Among these, object ID 9 is closest to the open doorway (ID 20) in the global view. Therefore, object ID 9 is the best match. Object ID 8 and 10 are also trashcans, but they are further from the doorway compared to ID 9. Object ID 11 and 12 appear to be trashcans as well, but they are not positioned near the open doorway in the global view. Thus, the ranking is based on proximity to the open doorway and the appearance of being a trashcan."
