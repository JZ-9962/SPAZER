Then, I cross-referenced these with the global view to see their spatial relationship to other objects, specifically looking for proximity to papers and a desk. Object ID 9 appears to be a trash can and is located near papers and under a desk-like structure, making it the most likely candidate. Object ID 10 and 8 also show similar characteristics but with less confidence due to less clear visibility of papers or desk proximity. Object ID 11 is included as a possible option due to its proximity to the described scene."
