I then examined the cropped images for objects resembling a trash can and checked for the presence of multicolored folders above them. Object IDs 31 and 34 appear to be trash cans, and there are multicolored items visible above them, which could be folders. Object ID 30 also shows a similar setup but with less clarity. Object ID 36 is included as it is in proximity to the other IDs and could be part of the same scene."
