The 'back side' would imply the side opposite to the viewer's perspective. From this viewpoint, the left side of the table is where chairs 11 and 12 are located. Chair 11 is directly on the left side, while chair 12 is slightly further back. Chairs 8 and 9 are also on the left but closer to the viewer, making them less likely to be considered 'back side'. Therefore, the top choices are 11 and 12, followed by 8 and 9."
