In the global view, object ID 7 is positioned to the left of object ID 0 and appears to be a smaller box-like structure. Therefore, object ID 7 is the most likely candidate for the query. Other nearby objects that could potentially fit the description include IDs 16, 17, and 12, but they are less likely based on their positions and sizes."
