Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **trash can**  \nQuery description: \"The correct trash can is NOT in the bathroom.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [10, 19, 77]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, object ID 77 is clearly located in the bathroom, as it is in the section with the bathtub and toilet. This matches the description of being in the bathroom, so it is not the correct trash can. Object ID 19 is located in the living area, near a chair and a small table, which is not typically a bathroom setting. Object ID 10 is positioned near a desk and chair, also outside of the bathroom area. Both IDs 10 and 19 are not in the bathroom, but ID 10 is more distinctly in a non-bathroom setting, near a desk, which is a common location for a trash can. Thus, the best match for the trash can not in the bathroom is object ID 10."
