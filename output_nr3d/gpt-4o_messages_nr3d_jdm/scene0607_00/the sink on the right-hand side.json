Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **sink**  \nQuery description: \"the sink on the right-hand side\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [16, 17]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I analyzed the spatial layout and identified the positions of the sinks labeled with IDs 16 and 17. The global view shows that ID 16 is positioned to the right of ID 17 when facing the counter. This establishes a view-independent spatial relationship where ID 16 is 'on the right-hand side' relative to ID 17. \n\nNext, I examined the camera images to validate this observation. Both camera images confirm that ID 16 is consistently on the right side when viewed from different perspectives. The view-dependent spatial relationships in these images support the initial assessment from the global view. \n\nTherefore, the object ID that best matches the query description 'the sink on the right-hand side' is ID 16."
