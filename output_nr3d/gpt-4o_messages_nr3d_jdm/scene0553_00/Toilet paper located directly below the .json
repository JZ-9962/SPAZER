Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **toilet paper**  \nQuery description: \"Toilet paper located directly below the metal holding bar and directly to the left of the toilet.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [2, 8, 19]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I identified the spatial layout of the room. The toilet (ID 2) is clearly visible, and the metal holding bar is above the toilet paper dispenser. The query specifies that the toilet paper is directly below the metal holding bar and directly to the left of the toilet. In the global view, object ID 8 is positioned directly below the metal bar and to the left of the toilet, matching the description. In the camera images, ID 8 is confirmed to be the toilet paper, as it is located in the dispenser directly below the metal bar and to the left of the toilet. Object ID 19 is above ID 8 and does not fit the description. Therefore, the best match for the query is object ID 8."
