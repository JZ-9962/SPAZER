Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **keyboard**  \nQuery description: \"The keyboard that is on the little side desk on the end of the big desks and is near the shelves.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [38, 40, 41, 43, 57]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, the query describes a keyboard on a 'little side desk on the end of the big desks and is near the shelves.' In the global view, object ID 41 is positioned on a smaller desk at the end of the larger desks and is closest to the shelves on the left side of the image. This matches the description of being on a 'little side desk' and 'near the shelves.'\n\nExamining the camera images, object ID 41 is confirmed to be on a smaller desk and is visually distinct from the other keyboards, which are on larger desks. The spatial relationship and positioning in the room align with the description provided in the query.\n\nTherefore, object ID 41 best matches the query description."
