Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **box**  \nQuery description: \"The correct box is in the middle.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [23, 29, 30]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I analyzed the spatial layout of the room. The query description specifies that the correct box is 'in the middle.' In the global view, object IDs 29 and 30 are positioned centrally along the wall, while ID 23 is located more towards the left side of the room. Next, I examined the camera images to validate these observations. The camera images show that IDs 29 and 30 are indeed positioned centrally on the shelf, with ID 29 being slightly more central than ID 30. Therefore, based on the spatial relationships and the description, ID 29 best matches the query as it is more centrally located."
