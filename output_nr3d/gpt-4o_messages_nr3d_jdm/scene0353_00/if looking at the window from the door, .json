Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **desk**  \nQuery description: \"if looking at the window from the door, the desk on the right.\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [2, 17, 47, 50]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, the room layout shows two desks positioned along the walls opposite each other. The query specifies the desk on the right when looking at the window from the door. In the global view, object IDs 47 and 50 are on the right side of the room relative to the door. Camera images confirm that these IDs correspond to a desk setup. Object IDs 2 and 17 are on the left side of the room, opposite the query description. Therefore, the desk on the right is best represented by object ID 50."
