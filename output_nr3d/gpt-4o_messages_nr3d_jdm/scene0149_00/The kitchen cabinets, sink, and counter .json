Follow the steps below:\n\n---\n\n1. **Start with the global view image**:\n   - Analyze the overall spatial layout and object distribution in the room.\n   - Use the global view to evaluate **view-independent spatial relationships**, which do not rely on a specific viewpoint:\n     Examples include:\n     - `near`, `close to`, `next to`, `far`, `above`, `below`, `under`, `on`, `top of`, `middle`, `opposite`\n\n2. **Then examine the camera images**:\n   - Validate candidate objects identified from the global view.\n   - Evaluate **visual features**: color, shape, size, texture, and material.\n   - Use camera views to judge **view-dependent spatial relationships**, which depend on the camera perspective:\n     Examples include:\n     - `left`, `right`, `in front of`, `behind`, `back`, `facing`, `looking`, `between`, `across from`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`\n\n    Tip: Annotations may not always be at the center of the object. Focus on the full **spatial extent** and choose the ID that best represents the **main body** of the described object across both views.\n\n3. **Iterate if needed**:\n   - If no candidate fully matches the query, return to the global view and reassess alternatives.\n   - Repeat verification with camera images until you confidently identify the best match.\n\n---\n\n**Task**:\nSelect the object ID of the target class: **unknown**  \nQuery description: \"The kitchen cabinets, sink, and counter plus part of the floor\"\n\nObject IDs to choose from: [0, 10, 4, 9]\n\n---\n\n**Output format (JSON)**:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain how you analyzed spatial relationships (view-dependent vs view-independent), cross-verified the object across views, and selected the best-matched ID.\",\n  \"object_id\": ID  // e.g., 10\n}\n"

        "content": "Starting with the global view image, I observed the overall layout of the kitchen. The query description mentions 'kitchen cabinets, sink, and counter plus part of the floor,' which suggests a large section of the kitchen area. In the global view, object ID 10 is positioned centrally and spans across the area where the sink and counter are located. This ID covers a significant portion of the kitchen, including the cabinets and part of the floor. \n\nExamining the camera images, object ID 10 consistently appears in the images showing the kitchen counter and sink area. It is visible in multiple views, confirming its association with the main kitchen area described in the query. The other IDs, such as 0, 4, and 9, represent smaller sections or individual cabinets, which do not encompass the entire area described. \n\nTherefore, object ID 10 best matches the query description as it includes the kitchen cabinets, sink, counter, and part of the floor."
